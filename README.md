## Overview
The **Business Insights 360 Project** iniciated as AtliQ Hardware faced limitations with Excel reporting, making it difficult to analyze key areas. I led the transition to Power BI, using a dataset of 1.8 million records to unlock clearer, data-driven insights.

## Project Description
The goal of this project was to create a comprehensive dashboard for stakeholders in sales, finance, marketing, and executives. These dashboards provide insights through key business metrics to facilitate data-driven decision-making.

### Key Objectives:
- Deliver practical insights to support smarter business decisions.
- Examine past performance data to monitor overall business trends.
- Assess the impact and success of marketing initiatives.
- Identify patterns in customer behavior and segment audiences effectively.

## Learned Techniques:
- Creating calculated columns.
- Creating basic and complex DAX measures.
- Data modeling involving 10+ tables.
- Page navigation with buttons.
- Creating a date table using the M language.
- Dynamic titles based on the applied filters.
- Using KPI indicators.
